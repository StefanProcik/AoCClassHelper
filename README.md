# AoCClassHelper
This program is a tool to help fans of the new upcoming MMORPG "Ashes of Creation" to find their favorite Arch and all available Information about it. It always stays up to date, because of its own Hyperlink creation mechanism.

# Why this Helper-Program?
I found the game myself only recently and wanted to know more about it, but at first I didnâ€™t know where I could find the wanted information. With this program, however, I can now access it compactly and very quickly and have all the information shown to me in one program. The information about it are always up to date, because it uses the www.ashesofcreation.wiki/ and searches the wanted Arch and the information about it, converts them into hyperlinks and provides them clickable.

# Target Scenario
You found out about the new upcoming game, which is still in alpha, and you think its so interesting its worth to find out more about it. The problem is, that the main webpage is not informative enough for you and you want the newest state of information and progress. With my program you see the Main-Archs and can combine them like you want. By doing that you always get the newest information, without going into the internet and looking up hundreds of forums to find the little information you wanted.

This was my first self made program that I build to train my Java coding abilities and also have an up to date state about a game that I was and still am.

This Project was for demonstration/learning purpose only
